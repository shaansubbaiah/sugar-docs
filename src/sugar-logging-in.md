# Guide to logging in with the Sugar desktop

  

You may have installed Sugar on Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, any other distribution by following the Sugar documentation or may have installed the Sugar Live Build on a Virtual Machine.

  

Each Linux distribution comes with a Display Manager. 

> A Display Manager (DM) is essentially a graphical login program, that
> lets you switch users or switch desktop environments.

The most popular display managers are `GDM`, `LightDM`, and `SDDM`.

* `GDM` is used with the GNOME desktop environment on Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora.

* `LightDM` is used with Raspbian on Raspberry Pi.

* `SDDM` is used with KDE.

To log in with the Sugar Desktop, select **Sugar** at the login screen before logging in.  Depending on the display manager, you may have to select a `gear icon`, `wrench icon` or a `dropdown menu` to do this.

  

## Some examples are shown below:
